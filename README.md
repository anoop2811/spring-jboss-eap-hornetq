# spring-jboss-eap-hornetq

This project came out of a lack of resources on how to connect to use spring boot and hornetq running remotely and
connecting through JNDI

This project is a sample all Java Config based spring boot project for subscribing to a queue in a horntq which
is deployed in jboss-eap version 6.4.

Inorder to run this, please create a queue with the name as TestQueue. You can do that using the jboss eap admin ui.
